    <h1>Ingridents</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>small pieces Chinese (cassia) cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 black cardamom pods (草果) </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>First place the aromatics in a piece of cheesecloth tied tightly with kitchen string or disposable/fillable tea filter bags. 
            That’s the cinnamon, black cardamom, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves, tangerine peel, bay leaves, white peppercorns, 
            licorice slices, sand ginger, and amomum white cardamon. Phew. It’ll be worth it. Trust me.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, rinse off the beef under cold running water. In a soup pot, add 16 cups of water, the ginger, and beef. 
            Bring to a boil and cook for a few more minutes until you see some foam floating on the top of the water. Skim the foam off. 
            You don’t want these impurities from the beef making your soup cloudy. Turn off the heat, fish out the pieces of beef, 
            and strain the resulting broth through a fine-meshed strainer, into a heatproof bowl or other pot. Set aside, along with the ginger pieces.
        </li>
    </ol>
